# Current Projects David is Working On

* Conceptual paper on the Ecological Internet of Things, preparing for submission

* Developing a framework for applying non-market valuation techniques to ecological data and ecological monitoring

* Evaluating the applicability of file compression ratios as an indicator of recording contents

* Building the Center for Global Soundscapes' next-generation data ingestion and processing toolset, [Chorus4Nature](http://soundscape01.science.purdue.edu/)

* Training new students in the Center in analysis of acoustic data, R programming, and scientific thinking

* Evaluating the influences of landscape composition and growing practices on the soundscapes of vineyards in Indiana and California

* Application of neural networks to forecast land-use change in the Midwestern United States, with tools that will eventually be used to inform community planning in Ohio

# Past Projects

## With the Center for Global Soundscapes
* Development of methodology for [unsupervised landscape classification](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361944458_Unsupervised_Clustering_of_Landscape_Classes_for_Acoustic_Sensor_Deployment_Planning), intended to develop categories to guide acoustic sensor deployment as part of a project to integrate remote-sensed data from the International Space Station with ground-based soundscape measurements
* [Silent Cities Project](https://osf.io/h285u/) data collection on acoustic impacts of early-mid 2020 Coronavirus lockdown impacts on urban soundscapes
* Development of training materials for acoustics based science learning course [(Your Ecosystem Listening Labs / YELLs)](https://edustore.purdue.edu/item.asp?Item_Number=FNR-607-W)
* Development of online sound-based science learning tool [iListen](http://ilisten.org)
* Development of [Community Soundscape Planning Guide](https://edustore.purdue.edu/item.asp?Item_Number=FNR-603-W)
* Development of [Acoustic Survey Design guide](/docs/sound survey design (1).pdf)
* Co-leading Soundscapes/Ecoacoustics conference Bogota 2019
* Design and construction of Purdue 150th Anniversary Borneo soundscapes exhibit
* Collection of local Coronavirus lockdown [impacts on air quality](https://purr.purdue.edu/publications/3632/1)

## With Conservation Metrics Inc
