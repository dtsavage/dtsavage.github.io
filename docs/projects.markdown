# Current Projects David is Working On

* Conceptual paper on the Ecological Internet of Things, preparing for submission

* Developing a framework for applying non-market valuation techniques to ecological data and ecological monitoring

* Building the Center for Global Soundscapes' next-generation data ingestion and processing toolset, [Chorus4Nature](http://soundscape01.science.purdue.edu/)

* Training new students in the Center in analysis of acoustic data, R programming, and scientific thinking

* Starting data collection for a new project evaluating the influences of growing practices on soundscapes in vineyards

* Application of neural networks to forecast land-use change in the Midwestern United States

# Past Projects

## With the Center for Global Soundscapes
